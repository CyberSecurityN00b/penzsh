# penzsh
Pentesting Framework for Oh-My-Zsh/PowerLevel10K

## Installation
For Oh My Zsh, git clone into $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/penzsh

Add 'penzsh' to your POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS (or RIGHT) in ~.p10k.zsh

## Features
   - Create git-like "penzsh projects" with a particular target; git-like because all sub-directories are part of the penzsh project.
   - zsh history files unique to each project, so you can go back to a target after a month and see what you last did.
   - Notes/todos unique to each project

## Caveat Emptor
This project is still very new and n00b. No guarantees, etc. In particular, the only target testing so far is for valid IPv4 addresses.

## Be Good, Do Good
Don't use this for malicious hacking, only wholesome pentesting. :)
